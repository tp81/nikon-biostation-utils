Stitching for the Nikon Biostation.

You need a directory of .ics (or .ics/ids pairs) files that contain the x y positions of each tile. These are in the ICS file, under `parameter` `origin`. Currently `x` and `y` origin coordinates are hard-coded to be in positions third-to-last and second-to-last.

## Usage
Open [Fiji](https://fiji.sc), download and drag this file onto the status bar. Press 'Run'. Point it to the directory of ICS/IDS pairs.
